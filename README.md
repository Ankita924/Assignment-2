Task 1: It takes input from the user and then the input enter the if loop. the test expression checks that when the input is divided by 2 it gives remainder as 0 or not. If it is true then it prints that the input given is an even number and if it is false then it moves towards thye else statement and prints that the input given is an odd number.
Task 2: Here we specify the counter variable as 0. Then the for loop test expression takes each value from the range(1,51) and then adds it with the count value. By doing so we get the sum of the numbers from 1 to 50.
